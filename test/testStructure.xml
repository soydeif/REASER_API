But Klapklok also features a Bluetooth app to create pixel drawings if that’s your thing. </p> <figure class="e-image"> <cite>GIF: Miniot</cite> <figcaption><em>A closer look at the lightweight flaps.</em></figcaption> </figure> <p id="caCAJS">As a clock, a selection of the flaps are redrawn every 2.5 minutes with a...</p> <p> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24283510/miniot-klapklok-low-resolution-wall-clock-price">Continue reading&hellip;</a> </p> </content>

That’s why, in order to keep customers happy and prevent them from going elsewhere, many retailers offer price-matching policies in which they promise to match a lower price found elsewhere. That kind of information comes in handy no matter the time of year, but it’s especially helpful during shopping events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p> <p id="DK0uFX">What follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to make note of here. First, all price-matching policies have a number of rules attached to them.

Is Meta getting paid for any of this? </p> <p id="WZ2y7o">When I asked Meta to elaborate, spokesperson Faith Eischen told me via email that “we’ve partnered with the US State Department to see how Llama could help address different challenges — from expanding access to safe water and reliable electricity, to helping support small businesses.” She also said the...</p> <p> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283985/meta-government-llama-ai-q3-earnings">Continue reading&hellip;</a> </p> </content>
